                Charles Leclerc’s race craft was superb in Las Vegas. He overtook the Red Bulls three times in the Grand Prix and his last gasp move on Sergio Perez was particularly impressive, earning him a well deserved second place. What made Leclerc so threatening in race trim was his ability on the brakes. He had already demonstrated what he could do on Lap 35, out-braking Perez for the lead from a couple of car lengths back at Turn 14. It was a move that seemed to catch the Mexican driver by surprise.<br>
                Leclerc had no answer to Verstappen’s outright pace and couldn’t halt the champion’s advances, but he did once again show off his braking ability compared to the eventual winner. As Verstappen looked to claim a comfortable move inside Leclerc into the final braking zone, the Ferrari man swept back around the outside of Verstappen almost by accident, such was the difference in braking points between the pole sitter and the race winner (see the clip below). Leclerc had a full two car lengths advantage in the braking phase, but Verstappen released his own brakes and still managed to complete the move. While Leclerc provided no real defence against the Dutchman, the tone was set for his battle with Perez. The slipstream advantage in Las Vegas was huge, thanks to the lengthy straights and slow speed corners, particularly in the second half of the lap. It meant that with similar pace, as Leclerc and Perez had, it was difficult for one driver to build a gap over the other. It even took a number of laps for Verstappen to creep away from the other two.<br>
                In Vegas he was probably guilty of not defending at all. Had he covered the middle of the road even, it may have been enough to deter Leclerc from his ballsy lunge, however Checo clearly didn’t think Charles could attempt the move from that far back and thus left the door wide open, inviting him to try. It was a spectacular ending to a brilliant battle between the two, who managed to exchange places an incredible four times on track in the second half of the race. <br>
